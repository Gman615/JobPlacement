# Live Project
As part of my coding boot camp through the Tech Academy, we worked on a live project with other peers creating a website through the web framework Django. I learn the most by doing hands on work and interacting with others. I also was able to learn how to clean up my code, create an API, and CRUD functionalty. We were given abstractions to create functionality for our personal site/application and were required to research how to do these on our own. Through this section of my camp, I was able to develop more self-assurance in my coding abilities. 

This document shows code snippets and a description of the live project done through the Tech Academy.

# Views.py

This section of code shows my views section from my Django Application with CRUD functionality, and an API.
